> ques:: A particle is initially at rest completed $N=1.5$ revolutions around a circle of radius $R=5 \text{ m}$ at a constant tangential acceleration during time $\tau=10s$. Calculate (i) the mean value of speed $\langle v \rangle$ (ii) the magnitude of the mean velocity $| \langle V \rangle|$ (iii) the magnitude of the mean acceleration $| \langle a \rangle|$.
