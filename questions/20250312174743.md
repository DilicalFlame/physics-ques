> [!question] Question 
> ques:: A motorboat moving upstream meets a raft moving downstream. After travelling for a period of $t_1 = 30min$ the boat reaches a landing place where it stops for a period of $t_2 = 1 hour$. The boat then travels downstream and meets the raft in $t_3 = 45 min$. Find the current velocity `u` by assuming the speed of the boat relative to the water `V = 8 km/hr`
