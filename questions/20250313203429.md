> ques:: A batsman lifts a ball almost from the ground with an aim of providing the maximum horizontal range to it. At the same time a fielder $40 \text{ m}$ away from the batsman runs at the speed of $10 \text{ m/sec}$ along the line of the hit and catches the ball. Find the velocity of the ball just after it is struck, $g = 10 \text{ m/}s^2$.
