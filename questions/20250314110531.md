> [!question] Question 
> ques:: Block $A$ of mass $m$ and block $B$ of mass $2m$ are placed on a fixed triangular wedge by means of a massless inextensible string and a frictionless pulley as shown in (fig). The wedge is inclined at $45^o$ to the horizontal on both sides. The coefficient of friction between block $A$ and the wedge is $\frac{2}{3}$ and that between block $B$ and the wedge is $\frac{1}{3}$. If the system of $A$ and $B$ is released from rest, find (i) The acceleration of $A$. (ii) Tension in the string. (iii) The magnitude and direction of the force of friction acting on $A$. ![[20250314110531 2025-03-14 11.08.52.excalidraw]]
