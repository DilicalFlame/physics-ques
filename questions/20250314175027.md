> ques:: A particle of mass $m$ moves in the $xy$ plane under the action of a force $F$ of constant magnitude rotating clockwise in the plane at a constant angular velocity $\omega$. At the initial moment the force is directed along the $x \text{ axis}$ and the particles velocity is $v_{o}$. Find the momentum of the particle as a function of time.
