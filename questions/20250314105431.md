> ques:: Two block $P$ and $Q$ of masses $6 \text{ kg}$ and $4 \text{ kg}$ respectively are connected through a rope of mass $2 \text{ kg}$. The two masses are placed on a frictionless platform as in (fig). The system of the blocks is pulled in the forward direction by a force of $60 \text{ N}$ applied on the block $P$. Find the acceleration of the system and tension in the rope at $\text{A, B and C}$. ![[20250314105431 2025-03-14 10.57.40.excalidraw]]
