> ques:: A small block of mass $m$ slides down an inclined plane forming an angle $\alpha=30^o$ with the horizontal. The coefficient of friction $k$ between the block and the plane is no longer constant but varies with $x$, the distance  travelled by the block on the plane, according to the equation $k=ax$, where $a$ is a constant. Find the distance travelled and the maximum velocity attained by the block before coming to rest.
