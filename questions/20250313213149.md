> [!question] Question 
> ques:: A bullet of mass $M$ is fired with a velocity of $50 \text{ m/sec}$. at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. At the highest point of its trajectory it collides head on with a bob of mass $3M$ suspended by a massless string of length $\frac{10}{3}\text{ m}$ and gets embedded in the bob. After the collision the string moves through an angle of $120^o$. Find (i) the angle $\theta$ (ii) the vertical and horizontal co-ordinates of the initial position of the bob with respect to the point of firing the bullet (take $g=10 \text{ m/}s^{2}$)
