> ques:: Two boats `A` and `B` move in perpendicular direction to a buoy anchored at some point `O` on a river. They travel with velocity `1.2v`, where `v` is the stream velocity, boat `A` moves along the river, whereas boat `B` moves perpendicular to it. After traversing an equal distance from `O` the two boats return. Find the ratio of the time taken by the two boats.
