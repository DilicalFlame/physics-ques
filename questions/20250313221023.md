> [!question] Question 
> ques:: Two identical spherical balls are simultaneously thrown towards each other from points $P$ and $Q$ horizontally separated by $8 \text{ m}$, and situated at heights $4$ and $8 \text{ m}$ above the ground. One ball is thrown from $P$ horizontally with a speed of $8 \text{ m/sec}$ while the other is thrown downward with an initial speed of $v$ at an angle of $45^o$ to the horizontal (fig). The two balls collide in space. Calculate (i) the initial speed of ball thrown from the point $Q$, (ii) co-ordinates of the point of collision and (iii) velocities of the two balls before collision. $g=10 \text{ m/}s^2$. ![[20250313221023 2025-03-13 22.14.19.excalidraw]]
