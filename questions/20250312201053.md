> [!question] Question 
> ques:: A particle initially at rest starts moving from the reference point $x=0$ along the x axis, with a velocity $v$ that varies as $v=\alpha \sqrt{ x }$ where $\alpha$ is constant. (a) How do the velocity and acceleration of the particle vary with time? (b) What is the average velocity of the particle over the first $s$ meters of its path.
