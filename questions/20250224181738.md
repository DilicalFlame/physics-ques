> [!question] Question 
> ques:: An object covers distance AB in the following manner. Half of the distance AB, viz. AB/2 = AC, is covered with velocity $v_0$. Of the remaining half, distance CD is covered with velocity $v_1$ for half of the time and DB with velocity $v_2$ for the other half of the time. Find the mean velocity of the object.
