> [!question] Question 
> ques:: A smooth semi-circular wire-track of radius $R$ is fixed in a vertical plane (fig). One end of a massless spring of natural length $\frac{3R}{4}$ is attached to the lowest point $O$ of the wire-track. A small ring of mass $m$, which can slide on the track, is attached to the other end of the spring. The ring is held stationary at point $P$ such that the spring makes  an angle of $60^o$ with the vertical. The spring constant $K=\frac{mg}{R}$. Consider the instant when the ring is released and (i) draw the free body diagram of the ring (ii) determine the tangential acceleration of the ring and the normal reaction. ![[20250314171303 2025-03-14 17.16.13.excalidraw]]
