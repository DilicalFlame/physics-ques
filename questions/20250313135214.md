> ques:: Two particles $a$ and $b$ initially at distances $l_{1} = 4 \text{ m}$ and $l_{2} = 3 \text{ m}$ from the point `O`, begin to move towards `O` with velocities $v_{1} = 3 \text{ m/s}$ and $v_{2} = 4 \text{ m/s}$ along two mutually perpendicular straight path intersecting at `O` (fig). After what time will the distance between the two particles be minimum? What will be the value of this minimum distance? ![[20250313135214 2025-03-13 14.05.42.excalidraw]]
