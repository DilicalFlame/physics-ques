> [!question] Question 
> ques:: Two particles A and B starts moving from a high point O at $t=0$ in the opposite direction with horizontal velocities of $3 \text{ m/s}$ and $4 \text{ m/s}$ respectively. Due to earth's gravitational field the two particles experiences uniform acceleration $g=9.8 \text{ m/}s^2$. How far apart are the particles when their velocity vectors become mutually perpendicular.
