> ques:: Two particle each of mass $m$ are connected by a light string of length $2L$ as in (fig). A continuous force $F$ is applied at the mid point of the string ($x=0$) at right angles to the initial position of the string. Show that the acceleration of $m$ is directed at right angles to $F$ is given by $$a=\frac{F}{2m} \frac{x}{\sqrt{ L^{2}-x^{2} }}$$ ![[20250314104713 2025-03-14 10.50.02.excalidraw]]
