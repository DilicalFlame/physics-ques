> ques:: A sphere of mass $m=\sqrt{ 3 }g$ fitted on smooth rod of length $2l=1 \text{ m}$ can slide freely along its length. Initially the rod containing the sphere at its middle is at rest. Now it executes a translational motion with a constant acceleration $a=2 \text{ m/}s^{2}$ making an angle $\alpha=60^o$ with it (fig). Find (i) the reaction force exerted by the rod on the sphere and (ii) the time at which the sphere will leave the rod. ![[20250314011203 2025-03-14 01.15.40.excalidraw]]
