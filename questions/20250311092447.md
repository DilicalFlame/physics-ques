> [!question] Question 
> ques:: A particle is moving in a plane with velocity given by $u = u_oi + (a\omega\cos\omega t)j$, where `i` and `j` are unit vectors along `x` and `y` axes respectively. If particle is at the origin at `t=0`. (a) Calculate the trajectory of the particle. (b) Find the distance from the origin at time $\displaystyle\frac{3\pi}{2\omega}$
