> ques:: A spherical ball is located at a point `A` (fig) at a height $h$ above the earth's surface. As it starts falling freely another similar ball is thrown from the earth's surface from the point `O`. With what initial velocity and at what angle should the ball be thrown from `O` in order to collide with the first one at `B` at an altitude $h_{1}=\frac{h}{2}$ after covering a horizontal distance $l$ ![[20250313201041 2025-03-13 20.18.00.excalidraw]]
