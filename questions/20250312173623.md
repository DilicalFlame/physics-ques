> [!question] Question 
> ques:: Two swimmers starting from `A` want  to reach to the point `B` by crossing the river in which the current velocity is $v_0$ by two approaches. One of them crosses the river along the path `AB` with a velocity $v'$ relative to water while the other swims at right angles to the stream with the same velocity and reaches to the point `C` (fig) lying on the other bank. At what velocity `u` he should run along `CB` so that both the swimmers reach `B` simultaneously. ![[20250312173623 2025-03-12 17.40.42.excalidraw]]
