> ques:: Starting from the point `O` along the road `OA` a person is interested to reach to the point `B` located in the field at a distance `l` from `A` by scooter in the shortest time. The speed of the scooter in the field reduces $\eta$ times that on the road. Calculate the distance of the point `C` (see Fig) from `A` at which he will leave the road in order to reach to the point `B`. ![[20250312171712 2025-03-12 17.20.05.excalidraw]]
